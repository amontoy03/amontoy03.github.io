    <section>
        <h3>Bad Website:</h3>
        <a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>
        <p>Craigslist is a website where users can buy, sell, and trade items, find jobs, and connect with local communities.</p>

    <div class="list-container">
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The site lacks strong contrast, using basic black text on a white background with minimal visual structure.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Although the layout is consistent, it feels repetitive and outdated, showing little visual progress over time.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The text and elements are properly aligned, but the overall layout feels outdated, lacking a modern and engaging design.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Information is crammed together in tight spaces, making it difficult to read and overwhelming for users.</li>
        </ul>
